# Capsule-Integrator

My project this semester comes in the form of a Rhino Plug-in called Capsule Integrator. This plugin offers architects, and city developers with a tool that allows them to endlessly integrate capsule housing units within the city. This plugin works by generating growing capsule structures in a selected region of a city.  Each form is made up of orthogonal capsules that are scaled each time they are stacked on each other. This results in a column made of capsules that expands as it moves vertically. Because of the proximity of the columns, intersections in the capsules create fan vaults like ceilings and archways. The form of the structure results in a small footprint, with large flat open spaces on the roof. The small footprint and vertical growth allows for this project to be generated over existing sites. This provides a way for the city to develop housing and green space over dull or unused sites such as railyards, industrial zones, steep hillsides, and waterways. This will allow for more affordable housing units and public green space to be integrated into Los angeles.
